In the rare event that we could not find a participant to match you with, we have instead matched you with average decisions based on previous research. </p> <p> For each task, we randomly assigned you to a role (if there were multiple roles) and determined the payoffs for you and the participant(s) you were matched to. </p> <p> Below are the results of each of the tasks. </p> <br> <p><u>Task 1</u></p> <p>In this task, all four people started with 100 points.</p> <p>You chose to contribute 30 points to the group project.</p> <p>Overall, only 3 group members contributed, and so the group project was unsuccessful. All points in it were lost.</p> <p>Your payoff for this task was <b>70 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><u>Task 2</u></p> <p>In this task, both people started with 100 points.</p> <p>In Phase 1, you chose to transfer 30 points to the group project, but the other person did not. The group project was unsuccessful, and so the points in the group project were lost. At the end of Phase 1, therefore, your payoff was 70 points.</p> <p>In Phase 2, you removed 34 points from the other person for their choice in Phase 1. This cost you 7 points.</p> <p>The other person removed 6 points from you.</p> <p>Your payoff from both phases of this task was <b>57 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><u>Task 3</u></p> <p>In this task, you were assigned the role of Person A. Both people started with 50 points.</p> <p>You transferred your 50 points to Person B, which was multiplied to 150 points. Person B then sent back 81 points.</p> <p>Your payoff for this task was <b>81 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><u>Task 4</u></p> <p>In this task, all four people started with 100 points.</p> <p>You contributed 90 points to the group project. The other group members contributed 53 points, 80 points, and 30 points. The total number of points was doubled and divided evenly between all people. This was added to your remaining points.</p> <p>Your payoff for this task was <b>137 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><u>Task 5</u></p> <p>In this task, you were assigned the role of Person A. You started with 100 points and Person B started with nothing. </p> <p>You offered Person B 92 points. Person B's minimum acceptable offer of 90 points was below this, and so they accepted your offer.</p> <p>Your payoff for this task was <b>8 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><u>Task 6</u></p> <p>In this task, you were assigned the role of Person A. You started with 100 points and Person B started with nothing. </p> <p>You transferred 25 points to Person B.</p> <p>Your payoff for this task was <b>75 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><u>Task 7</u></p> <p>In this task, you were assigned the role of Person A. All people started with 100 points.</p> <p>You chose to take points from Person B. Person B lost 50 points and you gained 30 points.</p> <p>As a result, Person C then removed 26 points from you.</p> <p>Your payoff for this task was <b>104 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><b> Your overall payoff from all tasks was 580 points. This means that your bonus for the study is $17.40. </b></p> <p> If for some reason, your bonus for the study ended up less than $10, then we have rounded it up to $10. </p> <p> Click Next to see a summary of your reimbursement for the whole study, and to provide your bank account details. </p> <p> <!-- .otree-btn-next is the CSS/jQuery selector for this button --> <button class="otree-btn-next btn btn-primary">Next</button> </p> </div> </form> <br/> <br> <br/> <br/> <br/> <div class="card debug-info"> <h5 class="card-header">Debug info</h5> </div> </div> <script src="/static/otree/js/reconnecting-websocket.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script src="/static/bootstrap4/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> <script src="/static/otree/js/init_widgets.js"></script> <script id="websocket-redirect" src="/static/otree/js/page-websocket-redirect.js" data-socket-url="/auto_advance/08hz3xx1,33/" data-redirect-url="/p/08hz3xx1/Payoffs/Payoffs/33/" data-is-browser-bot="False" ></script> <script type="text/javascript"> window.onload = function() { $('form#form').append('<input type="hidden" name="my_hidden_input" value="5" id="id_my_hidden_input" />'); } </script> <script> $(function () { $('.otree-timer__time-left').on('update.countdown', function (event) { if (event.offset.totalSeconds <= 600) { $('.otree-timer').show(); } }); }); </script> </body> </html>
