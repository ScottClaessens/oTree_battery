In the rare event that we could not find a participant to match you with, we have instead matched you with average decisions based on previous research. </p> <p> For each task, we randomly assigned you to a role (if there were multiple roles) and determined the payoffs for you and the participant(s) you were matched to. </p> <p> Below are the results of each of the tasks. </p> <br> <p><u>Task 1</u></p> <p>In this task, all four people started with 100 points.</p> <p>You chose not to contribute 30 points to the group project.</p> <p>Overall, only 2 group members contributed, and so the group project was unsuccessful. All points in it were lost.</p> <p>Your payoff for this task was <b>100 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><u>Task 2</u></p> <p>In this task, both people started with 100 points.</p> <p>In Phase 1, both people chose not to transfer 30 points to the group project. At the end of Phase 1, therefore, your payoff was 100 points.</p> <p>In Phase 2, you removed 50 points from the other person for their choice in Phase 1. This cost you 10 points.</p> <p>The other person removed 48 points from you.</p> <p>Your payoff from both phases of this task was <b>42 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><u>Task 3</u></p> <p>In this task, you were assigned the role of Person B. Both people started with 50 points.</p> <p>Person A transferred their 50 points to you, which was multiplied to 150 points. You then sent back 18 points.</p> <p>Your payoff for this task was <b>182 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><u>Task 4</u></p> <p>In this task, all four people started with 100 points.</p> <p>You contributed 53 points to the group project. The other group members contributed 90 points, 80 points, and 30 points. The total number of points was doubled and divided evenly between all people. This was added to your remaining points.</p> <p>Your payoff for this task was <b>174 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><u>Task 5</u></p> <p>In this task, you were assigned the role of Person B. Person A started with 100 points and you started with nothing.</p> <p>Person A offered you 92 points. Your minimum acceptable offer of 90 points was below this, and so you accepted their offer.</p> <p>Your payoff for this task was <b>92 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><u>Task 6</u></p> <p>In this task, you were assigned the role of Person A. You started with 100 points and Person B started with nothing. </p> <p>You transferred 24 points to Person B.</p> <p>Your payoff for this task was <b>76 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><u>Task 7</u></p> <p>In this task, you were assigned the role of Person A. All people started with 100 points.</p> <p>You chose to take points from Person B. Person B lost 50 points and you gained 30 points.</p> <p>As a result, Person C then removed 40 points from you.</p> <p>Your payoff for this task was <b>90 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><b> Your overall payoff from all tasks was 832 points. This means that your bonus for the study is $24.96. </b></p> <p> If for some reason, your bonus for the study ended up less than $10, then we have rounded it up to $10. </p> <p> Click Next to see a summary of your reimbursement for the whole study, and to provide your bank account details. </p> <p> <!-- .otree-btn-next is the CSS/jQuery selector for this button --> <button class="otree-btn-next btn btn-primary">Next</button> </p> </div> </form> <br/> <br> <br/> <br/> <br/> <div class="card debug-info"> <h5 class="card-header">Debug info</h5> </div> </div> <script src="/static/otree/js/reconnecting-websocket.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script src="/static/bootstrap4/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> <script src="/static/otree/js/init_widgets.js"></script> <script id="websocket-redirect" src="/static/otree/js/page-websocket-redirect.js" data-socket-url="/auto_advance/uk3gwjec,33/" data-redirect-url="/p/uk3gwjec/Payoffs/Payoffs/33/" data-is-browser-bot="False" ></script> <script type="text/javascript"> window.onload = function() { $('form#form').append('<input type="hidden" name="my_hidden_input" value="5" id="id_my_hidden_input" />'); } </script> <script> $(function () { $('.otree-timer__time-left').on('update.countdown', function (event) { if (event.offset.totalSeconds <= 600) { $('.otree-timer').show(); } }); }); </script> </body> </html>
