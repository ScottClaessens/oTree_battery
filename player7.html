In the rare event that we could not find a participant to match you with, we have instead matched you with average decisions based on previous research. </p> <p> For each task, we randomly assigned you to a role (if there were multiple roles) and determined the payoffs for you and the participant(s) you were matched to. </p> <p> Below are the results of each of the tasks. </p> <br> <p><u>Task 1</u></p> <p>In this task, all four people started with 100 points.</p> <p>You chose not to contribute 30 points to the group project.</p> <p>Overall, only 3 group members contributed, and so the group project was unsuccessful. All points in it were lost.</p> <p>Your payoff for this task was <b>100 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><u>Task 2</u></p> <p>In this task, both people started with 100 points.</p> <p>In Phase 1, both people chose not to transfer 30 points to the group project. At the end of Phase 1, therefore, your payoff was 100 points.</p> <p>In Phase 2, you removed 48 points from the other person for their choice in Phase 1. This cost you 10 points.</p> <p>The other person removed 50 points from you.</p> <p>Your payoff from both phases of this task was <b>40 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><u>Task 3</u></p> <p>In this task, you were assigned the role of Person A. Both people started with 50 points.</p> <p>You transferred your 50 points to Person B, which was multiplied to 150 points. Person B then sent back 19 points.</p> <p>Your payoff for this task was <b>19 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><u>Task 4</u></p> <p>In this task, all four people started with 100 points.</p> <p>You contributed 32 points to the group project. The other group members contributed 4 points, 93 points, and 9 points. The total number of points was doubled and divided evenly between all people. This was added to your remaining points.</p> <p>Your payoff for this task was <b>137 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><u>Task 5</u></p> <p>In this task, you were assigned the role of Person B. Person A started with 100 points and you started with nothing.</p> <p>Person A offered you 66 points. Your minimum acceptable offer of 21 points was below this, and so you accepted their offer.</p> <p>Your payoff for this task was <b>66 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><u>Task 6</u></p> <p>In this task, you were assigned the role of Person A. You started with 100 points and Person B started with nothing. </p> <p>You transferred 62 points to Person B.</p> <p>Your payoff for this task was <b>38 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><u>Task 7</u></p> <p>In this task, you were assigned the role of Person C. All people started with 100 points.</p> <p>Person A chose to take points from Person B. Person B lost 50 points and Person A gained 30 points.</p> <p>As a result, you then removed 79 points from Person A. This cost you 16 points.</p> <p>Your payoff for this task was <b>84 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><b> Your overall payoff from all tasks was 568 points. This means that your bonus for the study is $17.04. </b></p> <p> If for some reason, your bonus for the study ended up less than $10, then we have rounded it up to $10. </p> <p> Click Next to see a summary of your reimbursement for the whole study, and to provide your bank account details. </p> <p> <!-- .otree-btn-next is the CSS/jQuery selector for this button --> <button class="otree-btn-next btn btn-primary">Next</button> </p> </div> </form> <br/> <br> <br/> <br/> <br/> <div class="card debug-info"> <h5 class="card-header">Debug info</h5> </div> </div> <script src="/static/otree/js/reconnecting-websocket.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script src="/static/bootstrap4/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> <script src="/static/otree/js/init_widgets.js"></script> <script id="websocket-redirect" src="/static/otree/js/page-websocket-redirect.js" data-socket-url="/auto_advance/zmmaqusv,33/" data-redirect-url="/p/zmmaqusv/Payoffs/Payoffs/33/" data-is-browser-bot="False" ></script> <script type="text/javascript"> window.onload = function() { $('form#form').append('<input type="hidden" name="my_hidden_input" value="5" id="id_my_hidden_input" />'); } </script> <script> $(function () { $('.otree-timer__time-left').on('update.countdown', function (event) { if (event.offset.totalSeconds <= 600) { $('.otree-timer').show(); } }); }); </script> </body> </html>
