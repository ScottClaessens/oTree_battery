            Consent Form
        </h3>
    </div>
    <p>
        You are invited to participate in this study because you are a participant in the New Zealand Attitudes and
        Values Survey, and you have agreed to participate in an additional online study. You must be at least 18 years
        old to participate.
    </p>
    <p>
        The purpose of this project is to assess how economic decisions with others can predict attitudes and values.
        You will complete a series of interactions with other real participants. The decisions you make in these
        interactions will determine how much money you and they earn. The interactions are all slightly different, so
        you must read the instructions carefully and answer a comprehension question before each one.
    </p>
    <p>
        The entire study will take approximately one hour. For participating in the study, you will earn $20. However,
        you can also earn a bonus payment on top of that amount ($25-30). The bonus payment you receive will depend on
        your decisions in the interactions. Your total expected payment from the study is $45-50.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are no known risks associated with this research. Participation in this study is voluntary. You may
        withdraw from the study at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
        For payment purposes, sensitive information will be asked from you at the end of this study. If your preferred
        method of payment is PayPal, we will ask you for your email address. If your preferred method of payment is a
        direct online bank transfer, we will ask you for your bank details. If your preferred method of payment is posted
        cheque, we will ask you for your full name and postal address. This information will only be used for payment
        purposes, and will be permanently deleted immediately after the payment is processed by the University of
        Auckland. After payment, nothing will directly connect you to your name or contact details. Your participant
        number will only be able to connect you to your previous NZAVS responses, which are anonymised.
    </p>
    <p>
        The data from this study will be stored in an encrypted data file, which can only be accessed with a private
        key stored on a separate computer. These data will be stored indefinitely for research purposes. The final
        anonymous data file may be shared with other competent professionals on a case-by-case basis for research
        purposes. Your data will be reported in a manner that makes it impossible for others to identify your responses.
    </p>
