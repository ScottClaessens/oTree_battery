In the rare event that we could not find a participant to match you with, we have instead matched you with average decisions based on previous research. </p> <p> For each task, we randomly assigned you to a role (if there were multiple roles) and determined the payoffs for you and the participant(s) you were matched to. </p> <p> Below are the results of each of the tasks. </p> <br> <p><u>Task 1</u></p> <p>In this task, all four people started with 100 points.</p> <p>You contributed 30 points to the group project.</p> <p>Overall, 1 group members contributed, and so the group project was unsuccessful. All points in it were lost.</p> <p>Your payoff for this task was <b>70 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><u>Task 2</u></p> <p>In this task, both people started with 100 points.</p> <p>In Phase 1, you chose not to transfer 30 points to the group project, but the other person did. The group project was unsuccessful, and so the points in the group project were lost. At the end of Phase 1, therefore, your payoff was 100 points.</p> <p>In Phase 2, you removed 44 points from the other person for their choice in Phase 1. This cost you 9 points.</p> <p>The other person removed 3 points from you.</p> <p>Your payoff from both phases of this task was <b>88 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><u>Task 3</u></p> <p>In this task, you were assigned the role of Person B. Both people started with 50 points.</p> <p>Person A transferred their 50 points to you, which was multiplied to 150 points. You then sent back 117 points.</p> <p>Your payoff for this task was <b>83 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><u>Task 4</u></p> <p>In this task, all four people started with 100 points.</p> <p>You contributed 84 points to the group project. The other group members contributed 27 points, 89 points, and 28 points. The total number of points was doubled and divided evenly between all people. This was added to your remaining points.</p> <p>Your payoff for this task was <b>130 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><u>Task 5</u></p> <p>In this task, you were assigned the role of Person A. You started with 100 points and Person B started with nothing. </p> <p>You offered Person B 89 points. Person B's minimum acceptable offer of 17 points was below this, and so they accepted your offer.</p> <p>Your payoff for this task was <b>11 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><u>Task 6</u></p> <p>In this task, you were assigned the role of Person B. Person A started with 100 points and you started with nothing.</p> <p>Person A transferred 50 points to you.</p> <p>Your payoff for this task was <b>50 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><u>Task 7</u></p> <p>In this task, you were assigned the role of Person A. All people started with 100 points.</p> <p>You chose to take points from Person B. Person B lost 50 points and you gained 30 points.</p> <p>As a result, Person C then removed 92 points from you.</p> <p>Your payoff for this task was <b>38 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><b> Your overall payoff from all tasks was 560 points. This means that your bonus for the study is $16.80. </b></p> <p> If for some reason, your bonus for the study ended up less than $10, then we have rounded it up to $10. </p> <p> Click Next to see a summary of your reimbursement for the whole study, and to provide your bank account details. </p> <p> <!-- .otree-btn-next is the CSS/jQuery selector for this button --> <button class="otree-btn-next btn btn-primary">Next</button> </p> </div> </form> </div> <br/> <br> <br/> <br/> <br/> <div class="card"> <h5 class="card-header">Debug info</h5> </div> </div> <script src="/static/otree/js/reconnecting-websocket.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script src="/static/bootstrap4/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> <script src="/static/otree/js/init_widgets.js"></script> <!-- this is an HTML file rather than JavaScript static file because context variables need to be passed to it --> <script type="text/javascript"> $(document).ready(function () { var socket; function initWebSocket() { var ws_scheme = window.location.protocol == "https:" ?
