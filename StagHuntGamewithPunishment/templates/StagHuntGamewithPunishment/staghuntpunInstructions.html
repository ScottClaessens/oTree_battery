        Instructions
    </h3>
    <p>
        In this task you are matched with one other person.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of you will be Person A, one of you will be Person B.
    </p>
    <p>
        Both individuals start with 100 points.
    </p>
    <p>
        This task has two phases. In each phase, both people choose at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Phase 1</u>
    </p>
    <p>
        In Phase 1, both people will choose whether to transfer 30 of their points to a group project or not.
        The group project is only successful if <i>both people</i> transfer points to it, in which case the 60 points
        in it will be doubled and distributed evenly between both people. If only one person transfers, the group
        project is not not successful, and the points in it are lost.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are four possible outcomes in Phase 1:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Both people transfer; both people end the phase with 130 points.</li>
        <li>Person A transfers, but Person B does not; Person A ends the phase with 70 points,
        while Person B ends the phase with 100 points.</li>
        <li>Person A does not transfer, but Person B does; Person A ends the phase with 100 points,
        while Person B ends the phase with 70 points.</li>
        <li>Neither person transfers; both people end the phase with 100 points.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <u>Phase 2</u>
    </p>
        In Phase 2, each person then chooses whether they want to remove up to 50 points from the other person,
        based on the other person's decision in Phase 1. For every 5 points someone wants to remove from the other
        person, they must pay 1 point.
