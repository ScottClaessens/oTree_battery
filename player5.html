In the rare event that we could not find a participant to match you with, we have instead matched you with average decisions based on previous research. </p> <p> For each task, we randomly assigned you to a role (if there were multiple roles) and determined the payoffs for you and the participant(s) you were matched to. </p> <p> Below are the results of each of the tasks. </p> <br> <p><u>Task 1</u></p> <p>In this task, all four people started with 100 points.</p> <p>You did not contribute 30 points to the group project.</p> <p>Overall, 1 group members contributed, and so the group project was unsuccessful. All points in it were lost.</p> <p>Your payoff for this task was <b>100 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><u>Task 2</u></p> <p>In this task, both people started with 100 points.</p> <p>In Phase 1, both people chose not to transfer 30 points to the group project. At the end of Phase 1, therefore, your payoff was 100 points.</p> <p>In Phase 2, you removed 4 points from the other person for their choice in Phase 1. This cost you 1 point.</p> <p>The other person removed 4 points from you.</p> <p>Your payoff from both phases of this task was <b>95 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><u>Task 3</u></p> <p>In this task, you were assigned the role of Person B. Both people started with 50 points.</p> <p>Person A didn't transfer anything to you, and so you had nothing to send back.</p> <p>Your payoff for this task was <b>50 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><u>Task 4</u></p> <p>In this task, all four people started with 100 points.</p> <p>You contributed 17 points to the group project. The other group members contributed 28 points, 47 points, and 57 points. The total number of points was doubled and divided evenly between all people. This was added to your remaining points.</p> <p>Your payoff for this task was <b>158 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><u>Task 5</u></p> <p>In this task, you were assigned the role of Person B. Person A started with 100 points and you started with nothing.</p> <p>Person A offered you 9 points. However, your minimum acceptable offer was 35 points, and so you rejected their offer. </p> <p>Your payoff for this task was <b>0 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><u>Task 6</u></p> <p>In this task, you were assigned the role of Person A. You started with 100 points and Person B started with nothing. </p> <p>You transferred 63 points to Person B.</p> <p>Your payoff for this task was <b>37 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><u>Task 7</u></p> <p>In this task, you were assigned the role of Person A. All people started with 100 points.</p> <p>You chose not to take any points from Person B. As a result, Person C did not remove any points from you.</p> <p>Your payoff for this task was <b>100 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><b> Your overall payoff from all tasks was 657 points. This means that your bonus for the study is $19.71. </b></p> <p> If for some reason, your bonus for the study ended up less than $10, then we have rounded it up to $10. </p> <p> Click Next to see a summary of your reimbursement for the whole study, and to provide your bank account details. </p> <p> <!-- .otree-btn-next is the CSS/jQuery selector for this button --> <button class="otree-btn-next btn btn-primary">Next</button> </p> </div> </form> </div> <br/> <br> <br/> <br/> <br/> <div class="card"> <h5 class="card-header">Debug info</h5> </div> </div> <script src="/static/otree/js/reconnecting-websocket.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script src="/static/bootstrap4/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> <script src="/static/otree/js/init_widgets.js"></script> <!-- this is an HTML file rather than JavaScript static file because context variables need to be passed to it --> <script type="text/javascript"> $(document).ready(function () { var socket; function initWebSocket() { var ws_scheme = window.location.protocol == "https:" ?
