In the rare event that we could not find a participant to match you with, we have instead matched you with average decisions based on previous research. </p> <p> For each task, we randomly assigned you to a role (if there were multiple roles) and determined the payoffs for you and the participant(s) you were matched to. </p> <p> Below are the results of each of the tasks. </p> <br> <p><u>Task 1</u></p> <p>In this task, all four people started with 100 points.</p> <p>You chose not to contribute 30 points to the group project.</p> <p>Overall, only 2 group members contributed, and so the group project was unsuccessful. All points in it were lost.</p> <p>Your payoff for this task was <b>100 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><u>Task 2</u></p> <p>In this task, both people started with 100 points.</p> <p>In Phase 1, you chose to transfer 30 points to the group project, but the other person did not. The group project was unsuccessful, and so the points in the group project were lost. At the end of Phase 1, therefore, your payoff was 70 points.</p> <p>In Phase 2, you removed 8 points from the other person for their choice in Phase 1. This cost you 2 points.</p> <p>The other person removed 41 points from you.</p> <p>Your payoff from both phases of this task was <b>27 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><u>Task 3</u></p> <p>In this task, you were assigned the role of Person B. Both people started with 50 points.</p> <p>Person A transferred their 50 points to you, which was multiplied to 150 points. You then sent back 81 points.</p> <p>Your payoff for this task was <b>119 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><u>Task 4</u></p> <p>In this task, all four people started with 100 points.</p> <p>You contributed 9 points to the group project. The other group members contributed 4 points, 32 points, and 93 points. The total number of points was doubled and divided evenly between all people. This was added to your remaining points.</p> <p>Your payoff for this task was <b>160 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><u>Task 5</u></p> <p>In this task, you were assigned the role of Person B. Person A started with 100 points and you started with nothing.</p> <p>Person A offered you 21 points. Your minimum acceptable offer of 9 points was below this, and so you accepted their offer.</p> <p>Your payoff for this task was <b>21 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><u>Task 6</u></p> <p>In this task, you were assigned the role of Person B. Person A started with 100 points and you started with nothing.</p> <p>Person A transferred 62 points to you.</p> <p>Your payoff for this task was <b>62 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><u>Task 7</u></p> <p>In this task, you were assigned the role of Person A. All people started with 100 points.</p> <p>You chose to take points from Person B. Person B lost 50 points and you gained 30 points.</p> <p>As a result, Person C then removed 25 points from you.</p> <p>Your payoff for this task was <b>105 points</b>.</p> <br> <p><b> Your overall payoff from all tasks was 650 points. This means that your bonus for the study is $19.50. </b></p> <p> If for some reason, your bonus for the study ended up less than $10, then we have rounded it up to $10. </p> <p> Click Next to see a summary of your reimbursement for the whole study, and to provide your bank account details. </p> <p> <!-- .otree-btn-next is the CSS/jQuery selector for this button --> <button class="otree-btn-next btn btn-primary">Next</button> </p> </div> </form> <br/> <br> <br/> <br/> <br/> <div class="card debug-info"> <h5 class="card-header">Debug info</h5> </div> </div> <script src="/static/otree/js/reconnecting-websocket.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script src="/static/bootstrap4/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> <script src="/static/otree/js/init_widgets.js"></script> <script id="websocket-redirect" src="/static/otree/js/page-websocket-redirect.js" data-socket-url="/auto_advance/90lmip3s,33/" data-redirect-url="/p/90lmip3s/Payoffs/Payoffs/33/" data-is-browser-bot="False" ></script> <script type="text/javascript"> window.onload = function() { $('form#form').append('<input type="hidden" name="my_hidden_input" value="5" id="id_my_hidden_input" />'); } </script> <script> $(function () { $('.otree-timer__time-left').on('update.countdown', function (event) { if (event.offset.totalSeconds <= 600) { $('.otree-timer').show(); } }); }); </script> </body> </html>
